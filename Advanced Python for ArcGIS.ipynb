    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on Introduction to Python ArcGIS, this workshop will expand on those skills to further use Python in ArcGIS. The workshop will focus on the ArcPy Python site package to expand geoprocessing capabilities with Python. Participants will learn to build multiple standalone geoprocessing scripts covering different GIS tasks and workflows. The workshop will also cover how to create custom script tools in ArcGIS toolboxes for reuse and sharing. Participants will finish with the skills to explore more resources and options for utilizing Python in ArcGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Topics Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work with the ArcPy Python site package for ArcGIS\n",
    "* Explore the difference between Python scripts and ModelBuilder models\n",
    "* Build and share custom ArcGIS script tools for automation\n",
    "* Learn tips and tricks for validating script syntax and error handling\n"
